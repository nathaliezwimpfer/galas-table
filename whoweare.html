        <h3>Our Name</h3>
        <p>The company’s name was inspired by Les Diners de Gala, a “cookbook”
          created by the Spanish Surrealist artist Salvador Dali and originally
          published in 1973. The book is part cookbook and part artist book,
          where recipes share pages with Dali’s drawings as well as photographs
          of the surrealist dinner parties that he and Gala—his wife and
          life-long muse—hosted. Les Diners de Gala stands as a visual testament
          to how the table can be a catalyst for communion and creativity, where
          there is a space for a multitude of views and voices.
