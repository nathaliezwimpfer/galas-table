          <h3>Our Name</h3>
          <p>The company’s name was inspired by Les Diners de Gala, a “cookbook” created by the Spanish Surrealist artist Salvador Dali and originally published in 1973.
    The book is part cookbook and part artist book, where recipes share pages with Dali’s drawings as well as photographs of the surrealist dinner parties that he and Gala—his wife and life-long muse—hosted. Les Diners de Gala stands as a visual testament to how the table can be a catalyst for communion and creativity, where there is a space for a multitude of views and voices.</p>
